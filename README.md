🔍 Deepfake Detection Software

A machine learning–powered tool for detecting manipulated media (deepfakes). This project provides a framework for analyzing images and videos to identify whether content has been artificially generated or tampered with.

✨ Features

🖼 Image & Video Support – Detect deepfakes from still images or video frames

🤖 Deep Learning Models – Powered by CNNs/Transformers for robust classification

⚡ Real-Time Detection – Optional pipeline for live or streaming media analysis

📊 Explainability – Probability scores and visualization (e.g., heatmaps) for transparency

🔌 Extensible – Easy to integrate new models or datasets

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 3.x

PyTorch / TensorFlow (choose based on your implementation)

OpenCV for preprocessing

NumPy / Pandas for data handling

Flask or FastAPI (optional API deployment)
